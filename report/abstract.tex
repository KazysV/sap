In this report, we compare the Weighted Moving Average (WMA) algorithm, which selects weights based on a Gaussian function, with the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) algorithm. We demonstrate how these algorithms can be used to extract regular signal components such as trends, periodicity, and quasi-periodicity, as well as reduce existing or artificially added noises. We also investigate the effects of different algorithm parameters, such as K and L for WMA, and alpha for EMA, on the results obtained.
For a selected signal, we provide a complete analysis consisting of all the mentioned studies. However, for other signals studied, the report may not include illustrations of all the studies. During the discussion, we can demonstrate the operation of the omitted studies on a computer screen if required.
Keywords: Weighted Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, signal analysis, trends, periodicity, noise reduction.
